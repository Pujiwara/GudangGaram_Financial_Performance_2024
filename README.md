Description:
PT Gudang Garam Tbk (GGRM) is one of Indonesia’s largest cigarette manufacturers. This analysis reviews the company’s financial performance from 2020 to 2024 to address key questions commonly raised by management, investors, and finance teams.
The available datasets include the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement for the years 2020–2024.

Tools Used:
Excel, 
Power BI

Key Findings:
PT Gudang Garam faced substantial pressure in 2024: Revenue declined sharply (–17%), Net Income collapsed (–81%), Margins fell at all levels—GPM, OPM, and NPM—indicating loss of pricing power and rising costs.
Despite this, the company remains very strong in solvency with DAR at only 27% and a very low DER. However, short-term liquidity is weak due to a low quick ratio of 0.34x. CFO improved significantly (+48%), signaling better earnings quality, but ending cash continued to fall due to CFI and CFF outflows.
Overall, the company is experiencing a profitability crisis, not a cash crisis. The business is undergoing margin compression, but its strong financial foundation provides room for recovery through efficiency improvements and better cost management.
