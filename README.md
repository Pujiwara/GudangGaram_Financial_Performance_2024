Description:
This case study presents a comprehensive financial performance analysis of **PT Gudang Garam Tbk (GGRM)** over the period **2020–2024**, using publicly available financial statements.
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the company’s **financial health, profitability trends, capital structure, and cash flow sustainability**, as well as to identify the key drivers behind the significant performance changes observed in 2024.
By integrating **Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement** data into an interactive **Power BI dashboard**, this analysis enables management, investors, and finance stakeholders to gain actionable insights into operational efficiency, liquidity risk, and long-term financial resilience.

# Analytical Approach
### Methods
The analysis was conducted using a structured financial analytics framework:
- **Trend Analysis (Year-over-Year)**

    - Cash flow quality metrics (Cash Conversion Ratio, FCF to Revenue)
- **Cash Flow Decomposition**
    Detailed breakdown of **Operating (CFO), Investing (CFI), and Financing (CFF)** activities to assess cash sustainability.
- **Cross-Statement Analysis**
    Linking income statement performance with balance sheet structure and cash flow behavior to identify root causes behind profitability changes.

# Key Insight
- **Revenue declined by 17% in 2024**, while **Net Income collapsed by 81%**, indicating severe margin compression rather than a pure demand issue.
- **Operating Cash Flow rebounded strongly (+48%)**, suggesting improving earnings quality and better working capital management.
- Profitability deteriorated across all levels (GPM, OPM, NPM), reflecting **loss of pricing power and rising operating costs**.
- Declining ending cash balances indicate that **operational cash generation is not yet sufficient to fully fund investments and financing outflows**.
- Despite weak profitability, the company maintains **strong solvency**, with DAR at only 27% and low leverage risk.
- PT Gudang Garam is facing a **profitability crisis rather than a cash crisis**, supported by strong balance sheet fundamentals but challenged by operational efficiency.
- **Liquidity risk increased**, as shown by a very low Quick Ratio (0.34x), indicating heavy dependence on inventory.

# Business Recommendations
### **Revenue & Market Strategy**
- Reposition pricing strategies to respond to excise tax pressure and market competition.
- Focus on product segments with more stable demand.
- Optimize distribution efficiency and modern trade penetration.

### **Margin Improvement**
- Rationalize operating expenses (OPEX) across business units.
- Increase production automation to reduce long-term unit costs.
- Conduct SKU-level profitability analysis and discontinue low-margin products.

### **Working Capital Management**
- Accelerate inventory turnover to mitigate aging stock risk.
- Improve receivables collection to stabilize operating cash flow.
- Optimize raw material purchasing cycles to avoid overstocking.

### **Capital Allocation**
- Allocate strong operating cash flow toward efficiency-driven reinvestments rather than aggressive capacity expansion.
- Maintain conservative leverage while selectively funding high-return projects.
